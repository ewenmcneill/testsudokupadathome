# Expand out Sudoku TinyURL links, and redirect to local puzzle solver
#
# TinyURL is just a redirector to the full puzzle link.  We cache the
# results of these tinyurl links, for faster reopening the puzzles, and
# to avoid TinyURL being a single point of failure for replaying puzzles.
#
# There's also a SudokuPad shorturl service, which users URLs like:
#
# https://sudokupad.app/588su8gaub
# https://sudokupad.app/SETTER/TITLE
# https://app.crackingthecryptic.com/iix40twg6n
#
# which appear to work by fetching a regular page/JS, and *then* looking
# up the shortlink at, eg
#
# https://sudokupad.app/api/puzzle/588su8gaub
# https://sudokupad.app/api/puzzle/SETTER/TITLE
#
# and that API returns text string that is the puzzle definition (eg, that
# might otherwise have been part of the URL).  Our puzzle server can now
# proxy those api/puzzle/... requests to the online sudokupad, so we do
# not expand the puzzle definitions here.
#
# To override defaults, set:
#
# PUZZLE_DIR to a directory under which to save puzzle defintions
# FIXED_SUDOKUPAD to a base URL for the local SudokuPad local webserver
